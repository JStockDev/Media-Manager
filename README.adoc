= Media Manager

Woah finished a project for once, mental

Reworked from the original project media_interface, this one functions properly without leaking memory!!!

Designed to allow for media playback viewing and control from a mobile device, because those macro keys on the keyboard are terrible.

Comes with insane features including:

* Native Android app which still sometimes panics
* Windows server app which doesn't panic OR leak memory!
